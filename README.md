# Dungeon Clawler TUI - The Unraveling of K√°ndavael

A deceptive text-based roguelike that begins as heroic high-fantasy but slowly reveals cosmic horror through your own "successful" actions. Every victory corrupts the world further.

## üó°Ô∏è Game Concept

You've been summoned to the prosperous kingdom of K√°ndavael as their prophesied Champion! The benevolent Dael Tr√≠thae (Dawn Trinity) has blessed you to cleanse the land of the tyrannical Dusk Rhael's corruption. Villages celebrate your arrival with festivals!

But something feels... off. Why do prayers echo with a second voice? Why do the defeated Vardain (Wardens) plead "keep the mouth shut"? And why does the language itself seem to be changing?

By the time you realize the Dael Tr√≠thae are actually D√¶l Trith (draining throats) and every beacon you light weakens the V√¢r√∞ (sutures) holding reality together, it's too late. The Dusk Rhael was the D√ª≈°k Rhal‚Äîthe last hero who tried to stitch the wound closed.
