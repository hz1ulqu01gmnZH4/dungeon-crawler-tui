# Lore Bible - The Unraveling of Candlevale

## The Three Realities

### Earth (The Diseased Origin)
Your world of concrete and screens - a place you thought was real until you learned it's just another layer of meat pretending to be civilization. You bring the sickness of modernity: gunpowder, antibiotics, and the terrible knowledge that gods can be killed with chemistry.

### The Veil (The Rotting Lie)
The dying fantasy that Candlevale's survivors cling to while drowning in their own blood:
- Knights whose honor rusted with their swords
- Wizards who traded their sanity for parlor tricks
- Dragons that nest in the eye sockets of dead gods
- Kingdoms built on mass graves still warm

A bedtime story told by a realm that's been bleeding out for centuries.

### The True Layer (The Writhing Truth)
What's really there when you peel back the world's skin:
- "Gods" are tumors with mouths, feeding on faith like flies on rot
- Dragons are intestinal parasites the size of cathedrals
- Magic is the universe's death rattle, each spell a convulsion
- Prayers are screams that attract things that shouldn't exist

## The Summoning Incident

### The Prophecy
*"When shadows grow teeth and the last child stops screaming, the Fall-born Butcher shall arise to preserve the Feast."*

The prophecy was a trap, written in the entrails of the first prophet by things that feed on hope. Every word was bait.

### The Botched Ritual
Court Wizard Alaric, mad from decades of licking eldritch texts, tried to birth a savior from a circle drawn in children's blood. He was so drunk on fermented angel tears that he confused anime he'd glimpsed in prophetic seizures with actual summoning rites. He reached through realities and grabbed you - not a hero, just meat that thinks.

### The Wound
Your arrival ripped reality's hymen. The wound won't stop bleeding. Through it, the Outside doesn't just watch - it reaches in with fingers made of math that shouldn't work, picking at the scab of existence.

## Major Factions

### The Candle Knights
**Motto**: *"We burn ourselves to keep the dark fed"*

Once noble, now they're walking coffins of fused metal and rotting flesh. Their "blessed" armor is parasitic - it feeds on their humanity, replacing organs with iron prayers. Each oath carved into their flesh makes them less man, more weapon. They don't remove their armor because they can't - it's grown into their bones.

**Notable Members**:
- **Sir Gareth the Sleepless**: His eyelids were burned off. He sees everything, forgets nothing, screams in his sleep
- **Dame Morwyn the Hollowed**: Seven oaths ate seven pieces of her soul. She speaks only in blood and genuflection

### The Anatomical University
**Motto**: *"Knowledge is a disease we spread"*

A cancer of learning where professors vivisect angels to understand why God went quiet. Students pay tuition in memories and graduate missing organs. The University feeds on curiosity - literally. Each book in the library is bound in the skin of the scholar who wrote it, still warm, still growing hair.

**Departments**:
- **Void Surgery**: Removing parts of reality that have gone necrotic
- **Theological Autopsy**: Dissecting dead gods to find what killed them
- **Applied Amnesia**: Surgical removal of memories too dangerous to keep

### The Hollow Heralds
The corpses of previous isekai victims who didn't stay dead. Each summoning leaves them less human - they're composites now, built from the memories of a hundred dead Earths. They speak in wifi passwords and bleed television static.

**Known Heralds**:
- **The App That Walks**: Its face is a cracked screen showing a battery at 1%. Whispers in notification sounds
- **The Roadkill Bride**: Hit by every possible vehicle across infinite Earths. Her bones are tire tracks
- **The Speedrunner**: Exists in seventeen timelines simultaneously, all of them ending badly

### The Church of Blessed Mutilation
Salvation through systematic self-destruction. They gouge out eyes to avoid seeing truth, cut out tongues to prevent screaming revelations. Their holy communion is performed with hammers and nails. The truly devout are just stumps that pray - and somehow, their prayers are the only ones that work.

## The Lexeme Language

### Origin
The first language, spoken by reality itself before consciousness emerged. Each word is a fundamental force. Humans weren't meant to speak it - our throats are wrong, our minds too small.

### Discovery Method
Lexemes are found through:
- **Ancient texts** (risk: reading scars the mind)
- **Dying words** of cosmic entities (risk: they might not be dying)
- **Dreams** after viewing the True Layer (risk: dreams begin dreaming back)
- **Teaching** from Hollow Heralds (risk: learning their madness)

### Dangerous Combinations
Some lexeme combinations are forbidden for good reason:
- `SELF + UN + NAME`: Erases your identity, become nobody
- `TIME + REVERSE + ALL`: Breaks causality in a localized area
- `TRUTH + SPEAK + ABSOLUTE`: Forces reality to admit what it is

## Creatures and Entities

### The Listening Worms
They gestate in the space between words, born from lies that were almost true. They don't just mimic voices - they digest them, shit out new languages made of screams. In complete darkness, they wear your mother's voice like a coat.

### Corpse Dragons (True Form)
Dragons died out centuries ago. What people worship are their animated corpses, puppeted by colonies of parasitic wasps that nest in their brain cavities. Their "fire" is actually billions of burning insects. Their hoards are mass graves where they lay their eggs in human fat.

### The Abortion Saints
People who were retroactively never born, but refuse to stop existing. They're walking paradoxes that reality tries to vomit out. You can't look directly at them - your eyes insist there's nothing there while your hands feel their cold flesh.

### The Archivist
An entity that exists outside time, cataloging every possible version of every person. Offers "editorial services" - letting you retry choices by switching to alternate timeline versions of yourself. The price: the unused versions don't disappear, they're archived, aware, and angry.

### The Thing in Lake Vyr
Sleeps at the bottom of a lake that doesn't have a bottom. Dreams roads between locations that arrive before you leave. Those who travel these dream-roads sometimes meet themselves coming back. Neither version is wrong.

## Magical Items and Artifacts

### Unbooks
Books that remove knowledge rather than grant it. Reading one erases that information from reality. The library in Starfall University has a Restricted Unbook Section that steadily shrinks as people forget it exists.

### Eldglass Mirrors
Show the True Layer safely, but everything reflected learns your name. Look too long and your reflection starts moving independently.

### The Ear of the Forgotten God
A mummified ear that hears prayers to dead deities. Whisper a request to a god that no longer exists and sometimes reality glitches trying to process the paradox, granting the wish through error.

### Memory Wool
Spun from the fur of sheep that graze in the Memory Archive. Clothes made from it help you remember things you never experienced - but also make you forget things you did.

## Locations of Power

### The Inverse Tower
A tower that extends down instead of up. Each floor down is also a floor up. Mathematically impossible, it exists because no one's successfully disproven it. The bottom/top floor contains the beginning/end of everything.

### The Market of Lies
A bazaar where only false things can be sold. Buy a sword that isn't there, armor that doesn't protect, maps to places that don't exist. Paradoxically, in the True Layer, these items become real because lies are more solid than truth.

### The Garden of Ungrowing
Plants grow backward here, from fruit to seed to nothing. Spend too long and you might ungrow too. The gardener is an old woman who gets younger each year, forgetting more of the future.

## The Endings

### Return to Earth
Find a way home but leave Candlevale to its fate. You return changed - seeing shadows move wrong, hearing whispers in static. Earth isn't safe anymore because you brought something back with you.

### Become the Mask
Accept your role as Champion fully. The heroic narrative overwrites your identity. You save Candlevale but cease being you - becoming a story that will summon another victim someday.

### Break the Cycle
Destroy both the Veil and the True Layer, forcing reality to reset. Candlevale becomes something new - neither fantasy nor horror. You're erased in the process but reality remembers you as a scar.

### Embrace the Outside
Join the eldritch entities, become what watches from beyond. You gain cosmic power but lose human perspective. The game becomes you playing yourself from the outside.

### The Synthesis
Merge Earth knowledge with Candlevale magic, creating a new stable reality. Technology and magic synthesize into something unprecedented. You become the bridge between worlds, forever changed but still fundamentally you.

## Hidden Truths

### The Player is the Anomaly
Your modern Earth perspective isn't just flavor - it's the key. Eldritch beings can't predict you because you think in patterns they don't understand (memes, pop culture, scientific method).

### Candlevale is a Test
The entire realm is an experiment by cosmic entities to understand consciousness. Each isekai victim is a new variable in their study.

### The Summoning was Intentional
You weren't randomly selected. The Outside has been watching Earth through the internet, and chose you specifically for reasons that won't be clear until the end.

### Magic is a Virus
Lexeme magic isn't native to any reality - it's a virus that infected the cosmic entities eons ago. They spread it to mortal realms hoping to find a cure. Using it makes you part of the infection.

### The Memory Archive is Alive
It's not a place but a creature that feeds on experiences. Each death makes it stronger. If it gets enough memories, it'll become real enough to escape into Earth.

## Design Notes

### Tone Guidelines
- Wonder corrupted by dread
- Familiar fantasy tropes with horrible explanations
- Dark humor emerging from cosmic absurdity
- Hope existing despite impossible odds

### Player Discovery
Information should be layered:
1. Surface: Traditional fantasy adventure
2. Deeper: Something's wrong with this world
3. Deeper Still: Everything is wrong
4. Core: You might be the wrongest thing of all

### Sanity as Perception
Low sanity doesn't just show hallucinations - it shows TRUTH. The question becomes: how much truth can you handle and still function?

### The Isekai Paradox
The player simultaneously is and isn't the hero. They're the prophesied champion (Veil Layer) and the cosmic mistake (True Layer). Both are true. Neither are true. The paradox is the point.
