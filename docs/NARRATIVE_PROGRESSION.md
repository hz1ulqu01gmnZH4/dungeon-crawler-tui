# Narrative Progression - The Unraveling of Candlevale

## Core Deception: Start Heroic, End Horrific

The game presents itself as a classic heroic fantasy adventure that slowly reveals cosmic horror through the player's own "successful" actions. Every victory deepens the infection.

## Five-Act Structure

### Act I: The Making of a Champion (Floors 1-4)
**Tone**: Bright, earnest, slightly whimsical. NO horror hints.
**Language**: "Golden," "blessed," "harvest," "oath," "cleanse"

You're summoned to Candlevale, a prosperous town famous for beeswax and lantern festivals. The Dawn Triumvirate (clearly benevolent gods) has chosen you to defeat the last remnants of the tyrannical Dusk King.

**First Quest**: Train with Captain Lindrel, receive a blessed sword, rescue farmers from bandits.
**First Boss**: The Mire-Standard (animated banner of the Dusk King)
- It pleads in static: "Don't light the—" (reads as propaganda)
- Drops: Warden's Seal (tooltip: "Symbol of the old tyrant's cruelty")

### Act II: Cleansing the Land (Floors 5-9)
**Tone**: Hopeful, villages celebrating your victories
**Subtle Shift**: Prayers answer slightly too quickly

You relight beacon towers and sanctify waystones. Villages hold festivals when you succeed. NPCs smile more, shops offer discounts.

**Main Quest**: Light the Four Beacons of Dawn
**Second Boss**: The Bell-Keeper
- Journal entry: "I ring the bell to hold the quiet" (reads as mad zealotry)
- Death cry: "The mouth stays shut!" (transcribed as "The mob stays shut!")

### Act III: The Bloom of Dawn (Floors 10-14)
**First Cracks**: Small anomalies with plausible explanations
**Language Shift**: "Glowing" replaces "golden," "fervent" replaces "faithful"

- Beeswax candles burn longer than physics allows ("quality craftsmanship")
- Some monsters look defensive, not aggressive
- A grateful festival repeats verbatim in two towns ("traditional celebration")

**Third Boss**: The Marsh Warden
- Fights to protect chains in the bog
- Speaks: "I keep the mouth shut" (UI shows: "I keep the mob shut")
- Upon death, the chains rattle and something deep breathes

### Act IV: The Seethe of Light (Floors 15-19)
**The Pattern Flips**: Your successes cause instability
**Language Decay**: "Sallow light," "binding oath," "resonant mouths"

- Sanctified rooms draw tougher enemies that drop no loot
- Your Guiding Wisp completes actions you didn't request
- Beacons begin "singing" in the log
- NPCs greet you by accumulated titles before names

**Fourth Boss**: The Cathedral's Abbot
- Begs you not to kindle the Last Lantern
- Priestess Solane insists he's fallen to darkness
- Either choice advances the same hidden meter

### Act V: The Beacon (Floor 20+)
**Full Revelation**: The truth becomes undeniable
**Language Horror**: "Something counts your bones," "The Dawn weighs your hands"

The Last Lantern is the final seal. Lighting it "wins" but opens reality to the Triumvirate's feeding. Refusing begins Candlevale's decay. You've already done too much damage.

## Progressive Mechanics Corruption

### Light Radius System
```
Early Game:
- Light reveals secrets and traps
- Enemies avoid well-lit areas
- "Your torch pushes back the darkness"

Mid Game:
- Enemies begin pathing toward light
- Certain doors require minimum light to open
- "The light draws attention"

Late Game:
- Light increases hidden Attention meter
- "Night-kin" revealed as protectors fleeing your radiance
- "The light hungers"
```

### Blessing Evolution
```
Level 1-4: "Dawn's Blessing"
- +2 HP regeneration in light
- "The Dawn warms your hands"

Level 5-9: "Dawn's Embrace"

- "The Dawn holds your hands"
- [Blessing slot becomes locked]

Level 10+: "Dawn's Claim"

- "Something counts your bones"
- [Cannot be unequipped]
```

### The Guiding Wisp (UI Assistant)
```
Early:
- Highlights secrets
- Explains mechanics
- "Your helpful companion!"

Mid:
- Auto-loots "junk" items
- "Corrects" inventory counts in your favor
- "I'll handle the little things!"

Late:
- Consumes items to craft candles without asking
- Completes quests you didn't accept
- "We know what's best"
- [Dismissing Wisp removes map but reduces enemy spawns]
```

## Language Transformation Rules

### Noun Persistence, Adjective Decay
Keep the same nouns but transform their descriptors:

| Early Game | Mid Game | Late Game |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Golden sword | Gleaming sword | Greedy sword |
| Blessed altar | Fervent altar | Fevered altar |
| Holy water | Bright water | Burning water |
| Dawn's light | Dawn's glow | Dawn's weight |
| Heroic deed | Notable deed | Necessary deed |

### Victory Messages
```
Floors 1-4:  "Victory! The darkness retreats!"
Floors 5-9:  "Victory! The light grows stronger!"
Floors 10-14: "Success. The light spreads."
Floors 15-19: "Complete. The light feeds."
Floor 20+:    "Consumed. The mouth opens."
```

## NPCs: Virtuous Facades

### Priestess Solane (Main Quest Giver)
**Early**: Kindly mentor, gives healing potions, teaches prayers
**Mid**: Uses plural pronouns ("We are proud"), records your "measures"
**Late**: Asks for "two loving names" to forge the ultimate blade
**Truth**: Preparing you as the final sacrifice to feed the Triumvirate

### Captain Lindrel (Combat Trainer)
**Early**: Teaches combat, shares war stories, family man
**Mid**: Can't cross sanctified boundaries without you
**Late**: His training includes creeds you must recite
**Truth**: A puppet whose family token increases your light radius

### The Wardens (Apparent Villains)
**Early Presentation**: Corrupted lieutenants of the Dusk King
**Death Cries** (transcription changes over time):
- "Keep the mob shut" → "Keep the mouth shut"
- "Hold the dame back" → "Hold the dawn back"  
- "Bar the gait" → "Bar the gate"
**Truth**: They were the real heroes, holding the seals

## Hidden Meters

### Radiance (Visible)
Increases with: Beacons lit, prayers answered, bosses defeated
Effects: Light radius, blessing power, shop discounts

### Attention (Hidden until threshold)
Increases with: Light radius, blessed items equipped, shrines kindled
Effects: Enemy behavior changes, NPC dialogue shifts, reality distortions

### Memory (Meta-currency)
Gained by: Refusing blessings, sparing Wardens, extinguishing beacons
Spent on: Unlocking "dark" verbs (extinguish, unname, refuse)

## Threshold Events

### Threshold A (Radiance 25)
- First language shift
- Enemies path toward light
- Wisp begins auto-suggestions

### Threshold B (Attention 10)  
- Blessings lock permanently
- NPCs use titles before names
- Repeated events become noticeable

### Threshold C (Radiance 50)
- Warden speech stops being mistranscribed
- Beacons begin "singing"
- Map routes become restricted

### Threshold D (Attention 25)
- Stats renamed (Valor → Body, Wit → Mouth)
- Wisp acts autonomously
- The Abbot's warning appears

### Threshold E (Radiance 75)
- The Last Lantern manifests
- True vocabulary unlocked
- Point of no return

## Endings

### "Victory" Ending (Light the Last Lantern)
- The Triumvirate "ascends" you
- Credits roll over a brilliant, empty map
- NG+: Brighter start, fewer NPCs, world more hollow

### Refusal Ending (Extinguish Beacons)
- World dims to survivable gloom
- Wardens' sacrifices honored
- NG+: Darker but more human, true difficulty mode

### Abdication Ending (Never engage)
- Hunted by Heralds forever
- Slowly lose all titles and powers
- NG+: Unlocks "refusal" verbs from start

## Implementation Rules

### The First 90 Minutes MUST:
1. Give clean victory over mundane bandits
2. Light one beacon with zero consequences
3. Use cheerful, specific language (farriers, apple tarts, millstones)
4. Establish the Dusk King as the obvious villain

### Forbidden Early Game Words:
- No: void, writhe, hunger, teeth, meat, parasite
- No: cosmic, eldritch, squirm, feed, consume
- Yes: golden, blessed, heroic, cleanse, hope, dawn

### Every Revelation Tied to Player Agency:
- No random horror events
- Each shift triggered by: lighting beacons, accepting blessings, gaining titles
- The player is never punished for exploring—only for "succeeding"

## Example Item Transformation

### Festival Candle
```
Early: "Hand-dipped beeswax candle. Smells of honey and smoke."
Mid:   "Long-burning wax for shrine rites. Stabilizes light."
Late:  "Rendered tallow, holds clean edge. Whose? The wick remembers."
```

### Blessed Sword
```
Early: "Dawn-blessed blade. +3 damage to undead."
Mid:   "Dawn-touched blade. Grows warm near darkness."
Late:  "Dawn-claimed blade. Cannot be dropped. Drinks shadow."
```

## The Core Twist

You're not the hero. You're the infection vector. Every "heroic" action you take weakens the Vârð (sutures) the Vardain died maintaining. The Dusk Rhael wasn't a tyrant—he was the Dûšk Rhal (Twilight Stitcher) who understood what the Dael Tríthae really was: Dæl Trith (draining throats), and his "cruelty" was desperate attempts to keep people from feeding parasites.

The game never tells you this directly. You piece it together from:
- Mistranscribed death cries becoming clear
- Item descriptions shifting with understanding
- NPCs becoming less human as you "help" them
- The world becoming brighter but emptier

By the time you understand, you've already done too much damage. The question becomes: will you finish what you started, or try to undo it at terrible cost?
