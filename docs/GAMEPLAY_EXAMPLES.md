# Gameplay Examples - The Unraveling of Candlevale

## Example 1: Early Game - The Awakening

```
[Chapter 1: Birth Through Violence]

You wake choking on blood that isn't yours. The summoning circle 
is drawn in children's teeth and placenta. An old man wearing a 
robe of stitched tongues grins at you with too many teeth.

"Finally! Fresh meat that thinks! Take this blade and feed—"

> look around

[Insight +5] The summoning circle beneath you is wrong. Modern 
chemical formulas mix with ancient runes. One symbol looks 
suspiciously like the WiFi icon.

> examine wizard

Wizard Alaric, Court Magician. His pupils have split into three.
Black bile leaks from his tear ducts. His fingers have too many 
joints, and something under his skin writhes when he breathes.

> "Where am I? What year is it?"

"Year? 'Tis the third harvest of King Aldric's reign, of course!
Nearly 1247 years since the First Compact with the... the..."

[Sanity Check: Passed] His eyes unfocus. For a moment, you swear
you see something squirming behind his pupils.

"...the Benevolent Ones. Yes. The gods."

> take sword

The blade is warm and wet. The grip is wrapped in what you realize
is a child's face, stretched and tanned. It whispers your mother's
name when you squeeze it.

[Acquired: Kinslayer Blade - Attack +3, Sanity -1 per combat]

> "What am I supposed to fight?"

"The shadows grow bold! They've taken the lower chambers. But fear
not, for you are the Champion of—"

Something below screams with a hundred mouths. You hear bones 
snapping in rhythm, like applause.

> examine self

Your Earth clothes are fused to your skin with burn scars forming
runes. Your phone screen shows a photo of your family, but their
faces are holes. Battery: 47% and draining with your sanity.

[Status: HP 50/50 | Insight 5% | Sanity 95% | Notice 0%]

> go down

You descend stone stairs. Each step echoes wrong—the sound arrives
before you make it.

[Entering: Castle Lower Chambers]
```

## Example 2: Mid-Game - Lexeme Discovery

```
[Floor 5: The Anatomical Library]

The shelves are spinal columns. Books breathe wetly. A student 
reads nearby, pulling out her own teeth to turn the pages - the 
book demands payment for each word.

> examine student

She's reading her own autopsy report from tomorrow. Her lips move:
"Subject attempted to birth rabbits from her womb. Rabbits had
human teeth. Rabbits knew her name. Rabbits won't stop screaming."

> search forbidden section

[Insight Check: Required 30%, You have 42%]

You find the Restricted Section behind a door marked "FORGET THIS
EXISTS." Inside, books are chained not to prevent theft, but to
prevent escape.

> read crimson tome

[Sanity -10] The words crawl. You catch one: "FLESH"

[Lexeme Discovered: FLESH]

Your vocabulary expands. You understand: FLESH is not just meat
but the concept of being embodied, being real, being prey.

> combine FLESH + UN + NAME

[Notice +15!] Reality hiccups. You've created a Word of Unmaking.

SPELL CREATED: Sever Flesh from Identity
Cost: 20 Sanity, +10 Notice
Effect: Target's body forgets it exists temporarily

> test spell on rat

You speak the words at a rat in the corner. Its body phases out
of existence while its shadow remains, squeaking in confusion.
After 10 seconds, it snaps back, traumatized but alive.

[Warning: Notice has reached 45%. Something has noticed you.]

> hide

You duck behind a shelf as the library door opens. A Candle Knight
enters, armor covered in eyes that blink independently.

"The Archivist sensed an unauthorized edit. Show yourself,
Fall-born."

> examine knight through shelf

[True Sight Activated - Sanity -5]

The knight isn't wearing armor—the armor is wearing the knight.
Metal parasitically fused with flesh, each eye a different
person's, collected from those who "saw too much."

> whisper "I'm nobody"

[Earthcraft: Modern Psychology] You use confident body language
and social engineering.

"Nobody is here," you state flatly.

The knight pauses, confused. "If nobody is here, then..." His
eyes unfocus. The armor eyes close. He leaves, muttering.

[Current Status: HP 45/50 | Insight 42% | Sanity 80% | Notice 45%]
```

## Example 3: Mask System - The Scholar's Gambit

```
[Floor 8: The Debate Hall]

A surgical theater where thoughts are vivisected. Two professors 
duel with scalpels made of theorems, each cut opening wounds in 
reality that bleed equations.

[Wearing: Scholar Mask - +20% Insight gain, -10% Sanity loss,
Can speak Academic Cant]

> join debate

"Fresh meat for the grinder!" Professor Hedrick's grin splits his
face vertically. "Tell us, Scholar, what flavor is reality's marrow?"

> "Reality is a consensus hallucination maintained by collective
observation"

[Scholar Mask Resonance: Enhanced!]

Your words manifest as crystalline structures. The professors nod
appreciatively. Other students lean in.

"Interesting! But if reality is consensus, what happens to the
dissenter?"

> switch to True Layer

[Sanity -15, Insight +10]

The amphitheater is a stomach digesting ideas. The professors are
cancers with teeth. Students are tapeworms feeding on thought-bile.
Your words are gallstones that reality will shit out in agony.

> "The dissenter becomes either prophet or madman, depending on who
writes history"

[CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY! All listeners stunned by paradox]

The throat-theater spasms. You grab the Lexeme Prize from the
podium: "TRUTH"

> combine TRUTH + SPEAK + SELF

SPELL: Undeniable Existence
Effect: Force reality to acknowledge you as canonical

> cast on myself

[Notice +30!! Sanity -20]

Reality shudders and accepts you as a fundamental constant. You
can no longer be erased, forgotten, or unwritten. The Archivist
himself takes notice.

[CONSEQUENCE: You are now permanently part of this reality's story]
```

## Example 4: Earthcraft Combat

```
[Floor 12: The Bone Cathedral]

Phosphorescent marrow leaks from the walls. A Corpse Dragon writhes
ahead, its rotting flesh puppeted by wasp colonies. Its cult of 
kobolds chant while eating their own fingers in supplication.

[Current Loadout: Engineer Mask, Modern items: Smartphone (12%),
Multitool, Emergency flare]

> examine environment

Caves are rich with sulfur deposits. Bat guano covers the floor.
Natural saltpeter formations on the walls. Your chemistry
knowledge triggers.

[Earthcraft Available: Crude Explosives]

> craft black powder

Using your multitool, you carefully mix:
- Sulfur from deposits (75%)
- Saltpeter from walls (10%)  
- Charcoal from burnt torch (15%)

[Crafted: Crude Black Powder Bomb]

> examine dragon's hoard

Not gold—it's compressed suffering. Each coin is a child's last
breath minted into currency. The dragon feeds on kobold flesh, 
growing fat on their devotion-seasoned meat.

> "Hey, your god is false! Dragons aren't divine!"

[Social Attack using Earth Logic]

Three kobolds stop chanting, confused. The dragon's golden form
flickers, losing cohesion.

"SILENCE, MEAT! I AM ROT THAT DREAMS OF GODHOOD!"

> use smartphone flash – the last light of a dead world

[Battery: 12% → 8%]

The LED flash disorients the primitive creatures. More stop
chanting. The dragon's form destabilizes further.

> throw black powder at prayer-hoard
> shoot emergency flare

[CHAIN REACTION]

The explosion doesn't destroy the dragon—it destroys the prayers.
Without worship to feed on, the Lung Dragon reveals its true form:
a cosmic tapeworm, translucent and writhing.

> speak UN + NAME + DIVINE

[Lexeme Combination: Divine Rejection]

The parasite shrieks as divinity is torn from its identity. It
collapses into mundane flesh—still dangerous, but no longer
divine. The kobolds flee in existential terror.

[Victory: Lung Dragon (False Divine) Defeated]
[Loot: Heart of Unworthy Faith - Reduces Notice when equipped]
```

## Example 5: Late Game - The Harrowing

```
[Floor 18: The Bleeding Courthouse]

You've broken three oaths. The Harrowing has begun. Reality itself
hunts you. The courthouse processes your crimes against narrative
law.

[Status: HP 12/50 | Insight 78% | Sanity 23% | Notice 89%]
[Wearing: Cracked Knight Mask - Leaking eldritch truth]

> examine surroundings

The walls are made of compressed accusations. The jury is twelve
versions of you from failed timelines. The judge is a hole in
space wearing a powdered wig.

"THE DEFENDANT STANDS ACCUSED OF NARRATIVE VIOLATION. HOW DOES
THE STORY PLEAD?"

> "I plead that stories are meant to be broken"

[Low Sanity Response Available]

> laugh maniacally

Your laughter isn't sound—it's the absence of sound, deleting
other noises. The jury of yourselves flinch.

> access Memory Palace connection

[Meta-Progression Activated]

You pull knowledge from sixteen previous deaths:
- The judge's true name (learned run #3)
- The courthouse's structural weakness (run #7)
- The Harrowing's abort code (run #11)

> speak the abort code: "NARRATIVE + UN + BIND + SELF"

[CRITICAL OVERRIDE]

The Harrowing pauses, confused. You're refusing to play your role
in the punishment story.

> "I invoke the Right of Editorial Revision. I demand to speak with
the Archivist."

[The courthouse freezes. Reality buffers...]

THE ARCHIVIST MANIFESTS

It's not a being but a concept—the idea of documentation given
form. It speaks in marginalia:

"[Interesting. The subject has achieved meta-textual awareness.
Proceed to Ending Branch Ω-7: The Author's Paradox.]"

> examine myself through Archivist's eyes

[Sanity: -∞/+∞, oscillating]

You see yourself as the Archivist does: simultaneously the player,
the character, and the interface between realities. You're not
in the story—you ARE the story, telling itself.

[ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Narrative Singularity]
[New Game+ Available: Play as the Dungeon]
```

## Example 6: The Memory Archive Hub

```
[Between Deaths - The Memory Archive]

You float in conceptual space. Your apartment from Earth
reconstructs around you, but wrong—the TV shows other players'
deaths, the fridge contains bottled concepts.

[Deaths: 17 | Meta-Knowledge: 67% | Corruption: ████░░]

> review last death

Death #17: Spoke own True Name backwards. Existed in reverse until
reaching birth, then ceased.

Learned: Lexeme "TEMPORAL" 
Learned: Never experiment with time-based name magic

> examine corruption

The Archive is eating your memories. Your mother's face is 60%
static. Your real name is becoming "Champion." Your favorite song
is replaced with Candlevale's anthem.

> invest memory points

Available: 5 points
- Lexeme Mastery: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆
- Starting Sanity: 3/5 ★★★☆☆
- Earth Knowledge: 4/5 ★★★★☆
- Notice Resistance: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆
- Reality Anchor: 0/5 ☆☆☆☆☆

> upgrade Reality Anchor

[Warning: This will make you more "real" in Candlevale,
but less able to return to Earth]

> confirm

Your existence solidifies. Next run, you'll resist erasure and
unreality effects, but Earth feels more like a dream than home.

> prepare new run

Select Starting Mask:
1. Knight (Broken) - Starts with high Notice but can speak to
   Hollow Heralds
2. Scholar (Paranoid) - Sees True Layer by default, constant
   Sanity drain
3. Witch (Possessed) - Begins with three Lexemes but owes a
   favor to the Outside
4. Fool (New!) - NPCs underestimate you, random events increase
   300%

> select Fool

[The Fool's Gambit - Run #18 Beginning]

You wake in the summoning circle. Wizard Alaric looks at you.
"Oh no, I've summoned a jester by mistake!"

You smile. He has no idea how right he is.
```

## Combat System Detail

```
[Combat Encounter: Void Monk]

The Void Monk exists in negative space. Where he stands, 
reality isn't.

[Initiative: Monk wins - Notice too high]

> defend

The Monk punches with absence. Your shoulder ceases temporarily.
[-10 HP, Arm disabled for 3 turns]

[Your turn]

> combine LIGHT + OVERFLOW + POINT

[Spell: Blinding Singularity]
A point of infinite light manifests. The Void Monk, being
negative existence, cannot process this. He screams in reverse.

[SUPER EFFECTIVE: Opposite elements]

> follow up with Earth logic

"If you don't exist, how can you suffer?"

[Paradox Damage: The Monk takes 15 philosophical damage]

The Monk flickers, uncertain of his own non-existence.

> physical attack with blessed sword

Your blade passes through nothing and hits nothing so hard that
something happens. The Monk solidifies just enough to be cut.

[Victory: Void Monk Defeated]
[Learned: Combat technique "Aggressive Ontology"]
